## **About the Project**  
At Plymouth Housing, managing in-kind donations efficiently has been a significant challenge. Currently, these donations are tracked manually, leading to frequent errors and inconsistencies. This outdated system complicates the distribution of essential items to residents, delaying their access to necessary resources and impacting their quality of life.

Digital Aid Seattle is stepping in to revolutionize Plymouth Housing’s operations with a new, centralized inventory management system. Designed with ease of use in mind, the system will require minimal training, enabling staff and volunteers to quickly adapt. It will feature real-time updates, straightforward data export capabilities, and comprehensive dashboards.

The deployment of this inventory management system is set to significantly enhance operational efficiency at Plymouth Housing. By ensuring a smoother flow of donations from intake to distribution, we will facilitate faster and more reliable access to necessary resources for residents.

### **Built With**  
- [React](https://example.com)  
- [Vite](https://example.com)  
- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://example.com)
- [Azure SQL server](https://example.com)

## **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

- [**Node**](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

- **PowerShell** is required for bootstrapping the database. PowerShell is already installed on Windows. See database setup in next step for instruction to set it up on Mac.

- **SQL Server**. Either a locally running edition (highly recommended) or your own running in Azure. Developing against Staging will lead to conflicts. 

    See the [database section in the setup guide](/docs/setup-guide.md#local-database-for-development) for instructions how to set it up. 

### **Installation**  
Steps to set up the project locally:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digitalaidseattle/plymouth-housing.git
   ```  
1. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd plymouth-housing
   ```  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
1. Follow the steps in the [database-setup](/docs/database-setup.md) to install and bootstrap the database. 

1. The next step will throw errors if it can't find a connection-string as specified in [the config file](./swa-db-connections/staticwebapp.database.config.json). Make sure you have the environment variable for the connection string. 

1. Start the app locally with 
    ```
    swa start 
    ```
    For debugging you can add ```--verbose=silly``` to the ```swa``` command.
   
1. Go to http://localhost:4280.

   NOTE
   - The default Vite port 3000 is also available, but the app won't be able to access the REST API from there. This back end API is bootstrapped with configuration out of [```staticwebapp.database.config.json```](../swa-db-connections/staticwebapp.database.config.json). See documentation for all the settings. 

    - You can start the app with ```npm run dev``` but again, that doesn't set up the Data API layer. That is why you need to use the [SWA CLI](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/docs/intro).  

1. Here you get the default SWA emulation screen as descibed in the documentation. It requires you to fill out the user name. You also need to add either 'admin' or 'volunteer' in the roles section. This app uses it for the backend API.

## Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a consistent code style. The configuration for Prettier is defined in the `.prettierrc` file at the root of the project.

To exclude specific files or directories from formatting, you can add them to the `.prettierignore` file.

To format your code, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```
This command will automatically format all the files in your project according to the rules specified in the .prettierrc file.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can also set up Prettier to automatically format your code every time you save a file. Here's how:

- Install the Prettier extension from the VS Code marketplace.
- Open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl + , on Windows, Cmd + , on Mac).
- Search for "Format On Save" and make sure the "Editor: Format On Save" option is checked.
- Search for "Default Formatter" and select "Prettier - Code formatter".
- Now, every time you save a file, Prettier will automatically format it for you.
